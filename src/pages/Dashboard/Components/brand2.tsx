                    Being an end to end solution to the marketâ€™s need, Outcast
                    have identified broken links for both influencers and
                    brands, focusing on pain points such as no medium to reach
                    out to each other, no management of advertiser requests, no
                    data-based metrics to identify a campaign's results, no
                    medium to communicate exact requirements from either ends,
                    no financially trusted medium, and finally, no service
                    platform that either party can trust to make business flow
                    smooth. Through Outcast, we have developed a simplified
                    analytics dashboard ensuring transparent campaign analytics,
                    directly linked to Instagram leaving no room for confusions
                    or conversations. With real time results technologically
                    displayed to parties, Outcast serves as a medium to balance
                    accountability to transparency.
